# Diagtrack-Unsigned-Files

I've made a scanner that checks the diagtrack process for executables files that were ran AND unsigned. 

1. Open cmd as admin
2. cd into the folder where diagtrack.exe is located
3. Type "diagtrack.exe" and hit enter
4. For every unsigned exe, inspect it using ‚Å†die to determine if it is a cheat.
